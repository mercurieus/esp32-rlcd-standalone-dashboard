// would call that stretch "barely discharging" and then collapse at the knee.
// battery_percent() already carries the discharge curve; fitting downstream of
// it makes the straight line a reasonable model.
//
// `samples` is oldest-first. The window fitted is this discharge and only
// this discharge: the fit walks back from the newest reading for as long as
// the cell was only ever losing charge, and stops where a reading sits more
// than kDirectionChangeMarginPercent below a later one, which is a charger.
// So the window grows for as long as the board keeps running and resets when
// it is charged - the estimate gets more precise the longer it is left alone,
// and never averages a charge together with a discharge.
//
// This replaced a fixed two-hour window. That window existed because one fit
// was answering two questions at once - which direction, and how fast - and
// direction needs a short window while rate needs a long one. Direction is now
// answered far better and far sooner by the voltage signals in
// app_snapshot.hpp (eleven minutes, not two hours), which frees this to do the
// thing it is actually good at.
//
// Slots with no battery reading are skipped rather than interpolated, so a gap
// costs precision and never invents a measurement - and it extends the window
// rather than ending it, because a boot where the divider was unreadable is a
// hole in the evidence, not evidence of a charger.
//
// Slots recorded before a reboot are the caller's problem, not this
// function's: the ring stores a fixed interval per slot and knows nothing
// about the hours a board spent powered off, so the slot before a power cut
// sits five minutes from the slot after it. Passing a window that straddles
// one asks this to fit a discontinuity - see the recorder in app_main.cpp for
// the tail it passes instead.
