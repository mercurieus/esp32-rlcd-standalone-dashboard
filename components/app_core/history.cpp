  // by walking back from the newest reading for as long as the readings stay
  // consistent with one direction: through a discharge, older readings are
  // higher; through a charge, older readings are lower.
  //
  // Both directions are tried and the longer run wins, rather than guessing
  // the direction first from the last few samples. Guessing needs a
  // tie-break for a flat cell and gets it wrong exactly when the readings are
  // quietest; running the same loop twice costs nothing and has no such case.
  // Both matter: a board that booted onto a charger has nothing but the rising
  // run, and it is the only thing that can tell the panel so for the first
  // eleven minutes (see ui::battery_is_charging).
  //
  // The margin is what keeps quantisation from ending a run early: percent
  // has one-point resolution and the ADC noise under it is worth a point or
  // two, so a cell sitting still produces a sawtooth that is not a direction
  // change.

  // the divider was unreadable is a hole in the evidence, not evidence of a
