// Source: Bootstrap Icons' `lightning-charge-fill` (a solid filled shape,

// components/ui/assets/lightning-charge-fill.svg, MIT licensed - see
// UPSTREAM.md for the pinned commit. The upstream glyph is vertical; the
// tray needs it horizontal.
//
// To regenerate (e.g. after tuning threshold/min-stroke, or if the
// vendored SVG is updated):
//   python3 scripts/svg-to-bitmap.py components/ui/assets/lightning-charge-fill.svg
//   --width 22 --height 10 --rotate 90 --threshold 0.35 --min-stroke 1
//   --emit-rows kChargingBoltRows
// and paste the printed array back in below. --rotate 90 turns the
// upstream vertical glyph horizontal *before* rasterising, not after -
// rotating the finished bitmap instead would re-jaggify an already-
// rasterised shape. Threshold 0.35 (not the naive-looking 0.5) is what
// keeps tapered tips instead of dropping them.
//
// --min-stroke 1 (the tool's stated default is 2) is deliberate, not a
// typo: this glyph is a solid fill, already chunky by construction (the
// whole reason it was chosen over the outlined Material Symbols one), and
// at min-stroke 2 the dilation step puffs up the shape's own naturally
// tapered tips into round blobs that visually detach from the tapering
// line feeding into them - checked with scipy.ndimage.label, the
// min-stroke-2 mask split into multiple connected components where the
// min-stroke-1 mask is exactly one. Dilation exists to stop a taper
// thinning into a dotted line on an *outline* glyph; a solid fill does not
// have that failure mode, so forcing the same fix onto it just introduces
// a different one. Do not hand-edit the rows below to tweak the shape -

// tray_indicator_icon()'s own comment documents).
//
// A pixel is ink when exactly one of two things holds: its column is within
// `filled` (the level bar), or it is part of the bolt shape. That XOR is
// what keeps the bolt visible against both sides of the charge boundary -
// black on the empty part of the cell, knocked out to white on the filled
// part - while the level bar itself stays readable underneath it.
//
// History, because this design was rejected twice before and is now shipping
// anyway, which is exactly the kind of reversal that needs its reason
// written down rather than rediscovered. Two boundary-dependent designs were
// tried on the panel, both with a glyph already verified as one connected
// shape (see kChargingBoltRows's provenance comment - the glyph was never
// the problem):
//   - Clipped (AND-NOT): ink iff a column had charged AND the pixel was not
//     part of the bolt, nothing drawn past the charge boundary. At a
//     realistic charge level the boundary cuts through the bolt's kink, so
//     only one of its two strokes survives and the remainder reads as a
//     plain wedge, not a bolt. Still rejected - this one genuinely destroys
//     the shape.
//   - Inverted (XOR): this function. It was rejected on the grounds that
//     the eye segments the bolt's two halves by brightness before it can
//     fuse them into one shape. That criticism is fair and still true.
// What changed is not the criticism but what it was being weighed against.
// The solid-field version that replaced them - black field, bolt knocked
// out, no level at all - was acceptable only while "there is no trustworthy
// level to show anyway" held. It no longer does: the charger's contribution
// is measured at the cable step and subtracted before the percentage is
// published (app_core::battery_open_circuit_millivolts()), so a real level
// exists during a charge, and the operator asked to see it. A bolt that
// reads as two marks is a cosmetic cost; a battery icon that shows no level
// for the entire hours-long charge is a missing reading, and the second is
// worse. Do not restore the solid field without also restoring a place the
// level can be read while charging.
//
// `filled` is the number of ink columns the level bar occupies, counted from
// the left, in this rect's own coordinates - the caller's
// `body_width - 4` scale (see set_battery_icon_level()), not a percentage.
// Passing `width` reproduces the previous solid-field-with-bolt-knocked-out
// overlay exactly, which is what a full cell on a charger now draws.
//
// Pure: reads only its arguments, writes only to `out` (silently does
// nothing if `out` is too small for width x height - a canvas one pixel
// too wide must not scribble past its own buffer). No global state, so it
// needs no cleanup between calls: every call fully repaints `out` from
// scratch.
//
// `stride` (bytes between the start of one row and the next) is the
// caller's to supply, not this function's to guess. An earlier version
// computed it here as a bare `(width + 7) / 8` - the tightest possible
// pack; that turned out not to be the actual bug that round (LVGL's own
// `lv_draw_buf_width_to_stride()`, in LVGL's lv_draw_buf.c, agrees with
// that bare formula exactly under this project's current
// `LV_DRAW_BUF_STRIDE_ALIGN`, confirmed against the panel - the on-screen
// smearing that round had a different, unrelated cause), but deriving the
// stride from LVGL rather than assuming one is still the right call: a
// build with a different alignment value would otherwise drift silently.

// The shared building block behind every I1 canvas in this file

// on this exact panel - LVGL's I1 palette living in the first
// i1_canvas_stride/-storage bytes of the buffer, not a separate allocation
// (see g_charging_bolt_bitmap's comment, ui_theme.cpp), and LVGL padding
// each row to its own stride rather than a tight (width+7)/8 pack - only
// need working out once.
//
// i1_canvas_stride(): LVGL's own row stride for a `width`-pixel I1 row
// (wraps lv_draw_buf_width_to_stride() - never recompute this as
// (width+7)/8, see build_battery_charging_composite()'s own comment for
// why that drifts). i1_canvas_storage_bytes(): the minimum size a buffer
// passed to bind_i1_canvas() must be. bind_i1_canvas() itself creates the
// canvas, binds `storage` (which must already hold pixel data starting at
// i1_canvas_stride()'s own palette offset - see repack_i1_bits() above for
// how a tight-packed bitmap gets there, or build_battery_charging_composite
// for content computed directly at the right offset) and sets its
// 2-colour palette; `storage` must outlive the returned canvas, since LVGL
// keeps the pointer rather than copying.
// Where pixel data starts within an I1 canvas buffer - everything before
// this is LVGL's own palette (lv_draw_buf_set_palette() writes there
// directly; lv_draw_buf_goto_xy() skips exactly this many bytes before
// reading the first pixel). Genuinely constexpr - LV_COLOR_INDEXED_PALETTE_
// SIZE and sizeof(lv_color32_t) are both compile-time - so every caller
